Date: 2026-02-27
Current RUN_ID: `run-2026-02-27-sync-entrypoint-layer`

## What happened in latest conversation
- User confirmed the main pain is not command syntax but sync quality:
  new sessions/accounts/models often lose continuity.
- User asked to prioritize "same-frequency alignment" over operation mechanics.
- Decision: create top-level `SYNC/` as the single handoff entrypoint for both
  Codex CLI and web GPT workflows.
- Constraint: preserve wealth project roadmap content.

## Current output in this session
- Added `SYNC/README.md`, `SYNC/READ_ORDER.md`, `SYNC/CURRENT_STATE.md`,
  `SYNC/SESSION_LATEST.md`, `SYNC/DECISIONS_LATEST.md`, `SYNC/LINKS.md`.
- Added task + evidence for this change.

## Immediate next step
- Verify (`make verify`) and ship this RUN as one PR.
