## What happened in latest conversation
- User requested top-level governance convergence with sync priority.
- User approved:
  - canonical `PROJECT_GUIDE` in `docs/`
  - `CURRENT_RUN_ID` source-of-truth in `TASKS/STATE.md`.
- Goal shifted from tool ergonomics to strict cross-session same-frequency.

## Current output in this session
- Preparing P0/P1 implementation:
  - document owner/reference convergence,
  - `CURRENT_RUN_ID` default behavior in `tools/qf`,
  - tests for mismatch/fallback/default resolution.

## Immediate next step
- Complete implementation and verify with `make verify`, then ship one PR.
