# Summary

RUN_ID: `run-2026-02-24-queue-add-fix-runid-render-and-pytest-cache`

## What changed
- Added task file:
  `TASKS/TASK-queue-add-fix-runid-render-and-pytest-cache.md`.
- Confirmed queue-top unfinished item already exists in `TASKS/QUEUE.md` with
  TODO/Goal/Scope/Acceptance format, so no duplicate insertion was made.
- Created evidence bundle for this RUN_ID.

## Commands / Outputs
- `make evidence RUN_ID=run-2026-02-24-queue-add-fix-runid-render-and-pytest-cache`
- `make verify` -> `38 passed in 1.51s`

## Notes
- Scope-limited submission only; implementation of the queued fix is out of scope.
